# GravitySpheres

This project demonstrates an interactive 3D sphere packing visualization using WebGL and Three.js components. The application features a mesmerizing display of spheres that respond to gravity and color changes triggered by user interactions.

## Features

- **3D Sphere Packing:** A dynamic background with 300 spheres, varying in size and responding to gravity.
- **Interactive Controls:**
  - **Toggle Gravity:** Enable or disable the gravitational effect on the spheres.
  - **Random Colors:** Randomize the colors of the spheres for a vibrant visual effect.
- **Responsive Design:** Scales seamlessly across devices, maintaining a beautiful user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the application.
- **CSS**: For styling the interface.
- **JavaScript**: For interactive functionalities.
- **Three.js Components**: For rendering the 3D spheres.

## Customization

You can easily customize the simulation:

- Change the number of spheres by modifying the count parameter.
- Adjust the sphere sizes by modifying the minSize and maxSize parameters.
- Modify the gravity setting for a different visual effect.
- Feel free to adjust the parameters in the script.js file to match your needs!
